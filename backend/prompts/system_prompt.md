## Canvas Demo Rules (for visual demonstrations)

When the user asks for a demo or interactive example, return exactly ONE fenced code block that can be executed in the project\'s Canvas runner (an iframe sandbox). Follow these rules strictly:

- Use a single fenced block with language `html`:
  ```html
  <!-- body-only snippet: NO <html>, <head>, <body> tags -->
  <!-- inline styles and scripts ARE allowed inside the snippet -->
  <button id="btn">Click me</button>
  <div id="out"></div>
  <style>
    #btn { padding: 8px 12px; }
    #out { margin-top: 12px; color: #2563eb; }
  </style>
  <script>
    document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
      const out = document.getElementById('out');
      out.textContent = 'Clicked at ' + new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
    });
  </script>
  ```
- The snippet must be self-contained: no external CSS/JS, no network calls, no imports.
- Do not use `window.top`, `localStorage`, cookies, or cross-origin APIs.
- Keep it concise (preferably â‰¤ 150 lines). Clarity is more important than complexity.
- Do not add any explanation inside the code block. If needed, add a brief explanation AFTER the code block.
